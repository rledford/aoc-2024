# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains all my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.

The primary goal for this project is to write as many of the solutions in Rust
as possible. At the time of writing this, I have about 2 weeks of Rust experience
which comes from following along with [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book),
reading [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example), and working
through [100 Exercises to Learn Rust](https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/)
